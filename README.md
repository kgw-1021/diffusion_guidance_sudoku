🧩 Logic-Diffusion: Solving Discrete Constraints via Continuous Guidance
"Solving the hardest logical constraints with the most general diffusion models via the most flexible inference guidance."

📖 Introduction
Logic-Diffusion is a novel framework that solves discrete logical constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) using continuous diffusion models.

Unlike traditional solvers that require supervised learning on (problem, solution) pairs, this framework treats the solver as an Inverse Problem. We demonstrate that a standard diffusion model, trained only on the inherent structure of valid data (e.g., solved Sudoku grids), can solve complex logical puzzles by injecting constraints as energy gradients during the inference phase.

This approach bridges the gap between Generative AI (learning the manifold of valid data) and Symbolic Logic (satisfying hard constraints), offering a flexible, training-free solution for combinatorial problems.
